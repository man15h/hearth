# Integrations

Holm has two kinds of app support.

- **Tiles** work with any app that has a URL. List it under `apps:` in `config.yml` and Holm looks up its icon by name from [Dashboard Icons](https://github.com/homarr-labs/dashboard-icons) or [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org). No fixed list applies. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#apps).
- **Integrations** let users search *inside* an app from Holm's search bar, with each user's own credentials.

## Supported integrations

| App | What you can search | How users connect | Default scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Immich | Photos (smart search) | URL + API key | `!photos` |
| Paperless-ngx | Documents (full text) | URL + API token | `!d` |
| Nextcloud | Files | URL + username + app password | `!f` |
| Jellyfin | Movies, shows and music | Quick Connect sign-in, no key to copy | `!jf` |
| Planka | Cards, by name (cached up to 5 minutes, `cache_ttl`) | URL + API key | `!p` |
| Karakeep | Bookmarks (full text) | URL + API key | `!b` |
| Plex | Movies, shows and music | Code at plex.tv/link, no key to copy | `!plex` |
| Navidrome | Artists, albums and songs; optional player for songs | URL + username + password (only a derived token is kept) | `!nd` |
| Audiobookshelf | Audiobooks and podcasts | URL + API key | `!abs` |
| Mealie | Recipes | URL + API token | `!r` |
| Seerr | Movies and shows: play what's there, request what isn't | Automatic through Jellyfin or Plex; otherwise a Quick Connect code | `!sr` |

Integrations are marked Alpha in the UI. The only widget so far is Navidrome's player.

## Enabling an integration (operator)

An integration is invisible to users until it is listed under `integrations:` in `config.yml`:

```yaml
integrations:
  immich:
    enabled: true                             # false hides it; leaving the block out does too
    name: "Photos"                            # optional display name
    shortcut: "photos"                        # optional: !photos scopes the search bar to this integration
    default_url: "https://photos.example.com" # pins the server URL for every user
    tip: "Find the API key under Account settings"  # optional hint on the connect card
    surfaces:
      search: true
      widgets: false                          # Navidrome only for now: its player
```

The key (`immich`) must match the adapter id. If an app in `apps:` has the same `id`, the integration uses that app's icon. A block without `enabled` counts as enabled.

**Set `default_url` for every integration.** The server then uses that URL for every user, whatever the browser sends, including for connections saved before it was set. Without it, users may enter any `http:` or `https:` URL, and Holm, not the browser, makes the requests, so it can reach hosts inside your network; Holm logs a warning at startup for each integration without one. An app's `groups:` don't apply to its integration: every enabled integration is listed to every signed-in user.

## Connecting (users)

1. Open **Configure → Integrations**.
2. Pick an app and fill in the fields. Each field says where to find the key in that app, with a link to the right settings page.
3. Press **Connect**. The form tests the connection before saving it.

Jellyfin skips the form: Holm shows a code, the user approves it under Quick Connect in Jellyfin, and Holm receives that user's own token.

Plex works the same way: the user enters Holm's code at [plex.tv/link](https://plex.tv/link). Holm keeps only the access token for the server at the configured URL. For a server you only have shared access to, that token can't reach anything else. For a server you own, Plex returns your account token itself, so treat the stored connection as being as sensitive as your Plex account.

Seerr needs no sign-in of its own for users who connected Jellyfin or Plex: Holm asks Seerr for a Quick Connect code and approves it with the user's Jellyfin token, or passes Seerr the user's Plex token, and keeps the Seerr session that comes back. When that session lapses (Seerr keeps them 30 days), Holm renews it the same way. Holm only does this for the Seerr at `default_url`; a user who points Seerr at another URL signs in with a code. Holm asks Seerr which server it runs on, so the cards only point to the one that can sign in. When a user connects Plex, Holm lends Seerr that sign-in's account token once, so shared users connect too, not only the server's owner; the token isn't kept, so after the session lapses only the owner renews silently, and others sign in again with a code. Without Jellyfin or Plex in Holm, **Sign in** on the Seerr card gives a code for the app Seerr uses: a Jellyfin Quick Connect code, or a code to enter at plex.tv/link. Seerr on Emby isn't supported yet. If Seerr has no account for a Jellyfin user, the card says so instead of showing a code. Set `default_url` for Seerr, or the automatic connection can't know where Seerr is. Seerr must be able to log the user in: the Jellyfin or Plex account has to exist in Seerr, or Seerr's new-user import has to be on.

When results come from more than one of Jellyfin, Plex and Seerr, their movies and shows share one **Movies & TV** row, each title once: titles the user has first, then those they can request, then those already requested. Albums and artists stay in their own Jellyfin or Plex row. Music, from Navidrome or that row, shows as compact cards, three to a row on a wide window and two on a narrower one: a small cover on the left, the name on top and the details under it. Seerr results show each title once: if it's on the media server, it opens there (**Play**), and Jellyfin or Plex results for the same title are folded into it. When Jellyfin or Plex returned the title itself, its link is used and Seerr's status is ignored. Each poster has the icon of the app it opens in on its top-right corner, in the icon style picked for the apps: Jellyfin or Plex for a title the user has, Seerr for one they don't. Movies and shows the user has carry a play mark on the poster that plays them in Jellyfin or Plex. For a title that isn't there, hovering the poster shows a **Request** chip along its bottom that files the request in Seerr as that user; it spins while the request is filed and then stays as a disabled **Requested** with a clock, as it does for any title Seerr already has a request for. A show that's only partly there can still be requested from its Seerr result, and the request asks for just the missing seasons; when Jellyfin or Plex also returned the show, its result is the one shown and has no **Request**. Users whose Seerr account can't request (or can't request that kind of title) see no **Request** at all. Clicking anywhere else on a movie or show poster, from Seerr, Jellyfin or Plex, opens a detail view in the search panel (backdrop, year, runtime, rating, genres, overview, cast) with **Play on Jellyfin** or **Plex**, or **Request** and **Open in Seerr**; it never requests on its own. → opens it for the selected poster, and ← or Esc goes back to the results. While the row is still loading with nothing to show yet, it shows placeholder posters.

Navidrome has the first widget, a **Player**. The operator allows it with `surfaces: { widgets: true }` under `navidrome`, and each user turns it on with the **Player** switch on their Navidrome card; it starts off. With it off, a song opens its album in Navidrome like any other result. With it on, a song plays in Holm itself: clicking it, or Enter, starts it in a small player in the bottom-right corner (above the search bar on a phone) with the cover, title, artist, time played and length, and play/pause, stop and mute. There's no seeking or queue; picking another song replaces the one playing, and **Open in Navidrome** (⌘↵, or ⌘-click) still opens the album. The audio comes through Holm's proxy with the user's own token, as the original file, so the browser has to support its format (MP3, AAC, FLAC and Ogg play everywhere; ALAC only in Safari).

Navidrome asks for a password once. Holm computes the Subsonic token `md5(password + salt)` with a random salt and stores the salt and token, encrypted at rest, never the password. The token works for the Subsonic API until the password changes, and anyone holding the salt and token can try to brute-force a weak password, so use a strong one. Changing the username asks for the password again.

After connecting, results from the app appear in the search bar. Typing `!<shortcut>` searches only that app.

## Security

- **Per-user credentials.** Each user connects with their own key, so search results respect that user's permissions in the app.
- **Encrypted at rest** with AES-256-GCM. Set `HOLM_SECRET_KEY` to 32 bytes, hex or base64 (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Without it, Holm generates `.integrations-key` next to the database, so anyone with a copy of the data directory also has the key. See [configuration.md](configuration.md#integration-credentials).
- **Never sent back to the browser.** API responses redact secret fields. Thumbnails and previews are fetched through Holm (`/api/integrations/<id>/proxy/…`), so the key never appears in an `<img src>`. The proxy passes on images and audio only (other binary replies only as a download).
- **Tied to their server.** Changing a connection's URL to another host drops its stored key or token, so the new host has to be signed in to afresh.
- **Disconnect** deletes the stored credentials. A Seerr connected through Jellyfin or Plex is linked to it: disconnecting that Jellyfin or Plex disconnects Seerr too, and connecting it again brings Seerr back. A Seerr signed in with a code stays connected. A disconnected Seerr stays disconnected rather than reconnecting through Jellyfin or Plex on its own; **Sign in** on its card brings it back, and so does connecting Jellyfin or Plex again, through Jellyfin or Plex when it can and with a code otherwise. Jellyfin also revokes its token. To revoke a Plex sign-in, remove the "Holm" device under **Authorized Devices** in Plex. A Seerr code sign-in through plex.tv/link appears there as "Holm (Seerr sign-in)"; Holm doesn't keep that token, but Seerr saves it as the user's Plex token, so removing it leaves Holm alone and can stop Seerr's own Plex features for that user, such as watchlist sync.

## Adding an integration

An integration is one file plus one import line. The settings form, API routes and search bar discover it on their own.

1. Create `src/lib/server/integrations/<id>.js` that default-exports an adapter object:

   ```js
   /** @type {import('./_types.js').IntegrationAdapter} */
   export default {
   	id: 'myapp',                 // must match the config.yml key
   	name: 'My App',
   	shortcut: 'm',               // default !scope
   	description: 'One-line summary',

   	// Fields rendered in the connect form: url, text or secret
   	configSchema: [
   		{ key: 'url', type: 'url', label: 'URL', required: true, fromOperatorDefault: 'default_url' },
   		{ key: 'apiKey', type: 'secret', label: 'API key', required: true }
   	],

   	// Runs on Test and before Connect; message is shown as-is
   	async test({ config, fetch }) {
   		return { ok: true, message: 'Connected' };
   	},

   	searchProviders: {
   		items: {
   			label: 'Items',
   			mode: 'inline',
   			kind: 'media',           // optional: 'media' = posters, 'photo' = a grid
   			// layout: 'tracks',     // optional: override the layout picked from kind
   			// shelf: 'video',       // optional: join the shared "Movies & TV" row
   			async query({ config, query, limit, fetch }) {
   				return { results: [{ id, title, subtitle, thumbnail, href }] };
   			}
   		}
   	},

   	// Optional: serve authenticated images through Holm
   	proxy: {
   		thumbnail: { async fetch({ config, params, fetch }) { /* return a Response */ } }
   	}
   };
   ```

2. Import it in `src/lib/server/integrations/index.js` and add it to `KNOWN_ADAPTERS`.
3. Add an example entry under `integrations:` in `config.example.yml`.

The full contract, including `signIn` for device-code flows like Quick Connect, `signOut`, `linkedTo` / `connectFromLinked` for signing in through another integration, `actions` for writes from a search result, `details` for a result's detail view, and `prepareConfig` for swapping a typed secret for a derived one before it is saved, is documented in [`_types.js`](../src/lib/server/integrations/_types.js). [`karakeep.js`](../src/lib/server/integrations/karakeep.js) is a short, complete example.
