# Holm Vision

> The "why" and "what" — implementation choices push against this doc.

> **Status: a target, not a description of today's build.** Built so far: per-user app tiles on a grid, bookmarks, the launcher with integration search, onboarding slides, setup guides, and Navidrome's player as the first widget. Not built: the pinned / recently used / most used / all-apps widgets, RSS and other widget configs, the global custom CSS hook, and integration widgets for weather, Immich, Paperless and the rest. Integration credentials are each user's own, not wired once by the admin. First-week tips are switched off. Read this for direction; read [configuration.md](configuration.md) and [integrations.md](integrations.md) for what ships.

## Premise

Holm is a self-hosted dashboard an **admin sets up once** for everyone they share a homelab with — family, housemates, team. It is not a status console. It is a **glance**: a personal start page each user makes their own, hosted by someone who already runs the infrastructure.

This is what separates Holm from Homarr, Dashy, Homepage, and Glance: those are admin tools where one person configures everything for one viewer. Holm is multi-user from the floor up — the admin never authors a user's surface, and a user never edits the admin's catalog.

## Roles

**admin (global, in `config.yml`)**

- Catalog of self-hosted apps (with `default_visible` per app)
- Integration credentials — wired once
- Custom CSS theme — re-skin Holm to feel like Glance, Homarr, or anything else; default theme ships as today
- Onboarding slides — composable from built-in types
- Per-app setup guides

**User (per-user, in SQLite or localStorage)**

- Widgets on their surface — which ones, where, how big
- Pinned apps — explicit favorites
- Apps opted into from the broader catalog (anything the admin didn't ship `default_visible: true`)
- Bookmarks — external URLs (YouTube, Reddit, GitHub, anything), picked from a built-in default list or custom-added
- Widget configs — weather location, RSS feeds, etc.

## The surface

A user's surface is a grid of widgets they arrange by drag and resize. **There are no admin-defined categories.** That curation work is gone — the admin exposes apps, the product organizes them through smart built-in widgets.

### Built-in app widgets

- **Pinned** — user's explicit favorites; renders first when non-empty. The escape hatch from any algorithm.
- **Recently used** — last N opened by this user.
- **Most used** — frequency over a rolling window.
- **New apps** — added by the admin within the last 30 days.
- **All apps** — full grid: `default_visible: true` apps plus any the user has opted into from the catalog. Optional tag-based filter if the admin sets tags; no tags means no filter UI.

### Built-in non-app widgets

- **Bookmarks** — user's external links, picked from a built-in default list (YouTube, Reddit, GitHub, etc.) or custom URLs.
- **Integration widgets** — the existing set: weather, Immich, Paperless, Nextcloud, Planka, Karakeep. admin wires creds; user picks which to display.

Bookmarks and apps stay separate widget types. Mixing them ("recently used" across both) sounds tempting but quickly produces weird rows.

## First-run

1. User signs in.
2. The existing slide-based onboarding plays through — `welcome`, `services` (auto-derived from self-hosted apps), `privacy`, `security`, plus new generic slides (`pin-tutorial`, `bookmarks-intro`, `widgets-intro`) the admin can drop into `onboarding.slides` in any order.
3. After dismiss, default surface = **All apps widget alone**, populated with `default_visible: true` apps.
4. Everything else — bookmarks, more widgets, additional apps from the catalog — is opt-in. Nothing is pushed onto the user's surface.

The existing `services` slide, per-app `setup_guide`, and inline tips system continue to work — they key off `self_hosted: true` and `setup_guide`, not categories, so dropping categories doesn't break them.

## Customization

- **Theme (admin-only)** — a global custom CSS hook. UI elements expose stable class names so the admin can restyle without forking. Per-user CSS is deliberately not supported: the security surface stays tight and the look stays consistent for everyone in a household.
- **Layout (per-user)** — drag, resize, add, remove widgets on their own surface. Persisted per user.

## Non-goals

- **Technical dashboards.** No CPU, disk, container-health widgets. Tools that do that already exist; Holm is a glance, not a console.
- **admin-defined categories.** Replaced by smart built-in widgets and optional tags-as-filters.
- **Per-user CSS.** Theming is admin-only.
- **Pushing content at the user.** Surfaces show what the user opted into. No surprise widgets, no auto-injected suggestions after first-run.
- **Competing with single-admin dashboards on feature parity.** If a feature only matters for one viewer with all the credentials, it doesn't belong here.

## What changes from today

| Today | New direction |
|---|---|
| Apps grouped by admin-defined categories; users toggle visibility | All apps widget + smart widgets (pinned / recent / most-used / new); no categories |
| Drag/resize at the category level | Drag/resize at the widget level |
| Per-user customization = which apps are visible | Per-user customization = which widgets, where, plus bookmarks and opted-in apps |
| `default_visible` controls toggle-list defaults | `default_visible` controls what shows in All apps without opt-in |
| No admin theming knob | Global custom CSS as a first-class extension point |

## Open questions

- **Tags as a filter inside All apps** — yes, no, or defer? Easy to add later if not now.
- **Onboarding weight** — full guided tour vs. lightweight slides + persistent "Add bookmarks" / "Add widgets" + buttons on an empty surface? The lighter version is more aligned with "glance."
- **Cold start for Recently / Most used** — show them empty with a "use some apps first" hint, or hide until they have signal?
