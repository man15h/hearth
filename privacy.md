<!-- An example privacy page for a Holm server. It describes what Holm itself
     does. Edit it for your server before turning it on: add what your other
     apps store, your backups, and how people reach you. -->

This dashboard is run by the person who operates this server, on their own hardware.

## What this dashboard stores

- **Who you are, from your sign-in.** Your name, username and groups, as your sign-in provider sends them. They live in a signed cookie that expires after 30 days. The dashboard never sees your sign-in password.
- **Your preferences.** Your layout, bookmarks, theme, wallpaper and weather location, on this server so they follow you between devices.
- **Apps you connect.** If you connect an app to search it from here, the key, token or app password you give is stored on this server, encrypted. For Navidrome, a token derived from your password is stored, not the password. Disconnecting deletes it.

## What leaves this server

- **Weather.** Your browser sends the place you search for, or your coordinates if you use your location, to Open-Meteo, and to OpenStreetMap's Nominatim to name the place.
- **Web search.** A query you send to the fallback search engine goes to that engine.
- **Pictures.** Wallpapers, icons and posters are fetched by the server from public sources (wsrv.nl and GitLab, jsDelivr and Simple Icons, TMDB), not by your browser. The exception is a logo, font or icon the operator links by URL in the server's configuration: your browser loads that from wherever it's hosted.

## What this dashboard doesn't do

- No analytics, tracking or telemetry
- No advertising, and no selling or sharing of your data

## Questions

Ask the server operator to see or delete what's stored about you.
